# :sparkles: What is MiniTalk?

MiniTalk Project in 42

The MiniTalk project in the 42 curriculum focuses on implementing a simple messaging system using UNIX signals and inter-process communication (IPC). The goal is to create a client-server application that allows two processes to communicate via signals, enabling message transmission using minimal resources and avoiding standard library functions like `send` or `recv`. This project teaches essential low-level programming concepts such as signal handling, memory management, and process communication.

Why Implement MiniTalk?

In the 42 curriculum, students are encouraged to build their own versions of basic communication mechanisms to better understand how processes interact at a low level. The MiniTalk project is designed to teach signal-based communication, buffer handling, and process synchronization. By completing this project, students will gain experience in creating efficient, modular, and reusable code that adheres to strict coding norms. The project also provides a hands-on opportunity to work with signals and IPC, essential for mastering system-level programming.

Objectives of the Project

1. **Signal Handling:** Learn how to send and receive signals between processes to transmit messages.
2. **Process Communication:** Implement communication between a client and a server using signals and message encoding.
3. **Memory Management:** Manage buffers and memory effectively to store and transmit message data without memory leaks.
4. **Modular Code:** Write efficient and reusable code that adheres to strict coding norms, focusing on clarity and performance.
5. **Handling Different Message Sources:** Implement the ability to read messages from different sources, such as stdin and a network connection, using signals.
6. **Norm Compliance:** Develop code that follows the strict coding standards of the 42 curriculum, ensuring maintainability and readability.
7. **Bonus - Multi-client Communication:** Extend the functionality of the original MiniTalk to allow communication with multiple clients simultaneously, supporting parallel message exchange.
